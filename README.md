# Cars-Risk-Assessments-Using-ML

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict car risk assessments, known as symboling, which is widely used in the automotive and insurance industries. Accurate predictions of symbolling enable insurers to tailor premiums correctly, and consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions. Furthermore, predicting symboling can assist fleet managers in selecting cost-effective vehicles, financial institutions in evaluating loan and lease terms, and manufacturers in improving the safety features of their cars. By leveraging machine-learning techniques, the accuracy of symboling predictions can be enhanced, allowing for more accurate risk assessments and better management of potential financial and operational impacts across various sectors.
